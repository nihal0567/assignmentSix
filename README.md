Scope Re-declaration Re-assignment (Mutability) Hoisting

1. forEach()

Purpose: To iterate over an array and perform a function on each element.

Returns: undefined (does not return a new array).

Mutability: Can modify the original array if you change elements inside the callback.

2. map()

Purpose: To transform each element of an array.

Returns: A new array with transformed values.

Mutability: Does not modify the original array unless you explicitly do so.

3. filter()

Purpose: To select elements that pass a condition.

Returns: A new array containing elements that satisfy the condition.

Mutability: Original array is unchanged.
